# ðŸ§­ Zebra Scanner/Scale OPOS Named Pipe Program

A lightweight C# program that interfaces with Zebra scanner and scale devices using the OPOS standard. This project exposes **live weight data** and **scanned barcode values** via **named pipes**, enabling seamless integration with external applications (e.g., Python, Node.js, etc.).

It can work with other scanner/scales from other manufacturers, but it has only been tested with Zebra devices for now.
